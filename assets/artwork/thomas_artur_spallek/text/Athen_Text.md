## Temple Game
The Internet and the digitalization made this cultural values flexible (Distribution of content) – Mass amateurization and gamification shifted the capabilities of non-professionals to read and filter content. New media technology increased the possibilities of producing and transforming those content. These new strategies shifted the form of culture we create nowadays. As the Parthenon was envisioned by Pericles (c. 495 – 429 BC) as a cultural monument built by professionals to resist for the future. Nowadays‘ production of cultural artifacts have shifted these matters of intention, into a trivial action of posting, retweeting, liking by everyday people, taking action mostly on social networks and blogs operated by its users. Depending on the cultural situation and the frequency an cultural idea is shared, these digital contents can reach an unexpected status for our present culture representing the various positions created by a massive group of people around the world. „The regestures – such as reflagging and retweeting – have become cultural rites of cachet in and of themselves. Sorting and filtering – moving informations – has become a site of cultural capital. [2] Kenneth Goldsmith, Uncreative Writing, Infallible Process, p.139, 2011
