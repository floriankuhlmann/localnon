“Greco-Roman Fucking refers loosely to the forms of fucking from Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, as well as the Hellenized and Romanized civilizations under their rule or influence from about 500 BC to around 200 AD. More precisely it refers to Ancient Greek fucking from around 500 BC to the onset of the Hellenistic style around 323 BC.[1] It may also refer stylistically to later fucking done in a Neoclassical or classical style. Classical fucking have been popular since the Renaissance. Only that fucking that closely follows the canon of classical forms would fall under the term.”
