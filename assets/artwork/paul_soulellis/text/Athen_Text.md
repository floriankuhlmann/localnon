Short text

Can a publication be a GIF? The third issue of Printed Web takes the form of books, zines and fabric skins — a meager attempt to fix some stability into the collected work of 147 artists as printout matter. Downloads of ZIPs and PDFs allow readers of Printed Web 3 to perform their own digital versions of the material. Printed_Web_3.gif contains 147 page-frames — one digital file from every artist who submitted to the Printed Web open call in January–February 2015.

Earlier this year, I announced an open call for the third issue of Printed Web. I received a fascinating array of files from recognized artists like Olia Lialina, Kim Asendorf and Clement Valla, but the beauty of the open call was exposing the project to a new group of artists working with material found or created on the web — 147 contributors in all. A particularly diverse view of networked culture formed on my desktop as notes, attachments, tweets and downloads, all with the intention to "make public." Gathering this community of artists around Printed Web was immensely satisfying for me, but the challenge to be inclusive in the presentation of the work has been real. I received hundreds of PDFs, JPGs, PNGs and GIFs.

My intention had always been to include all of the files received, but "scattering" the material as different networked versions allows the project to occupy multiple positions. Printed Web 3 is primarily an act of digital publishing, so a cheap, black-and-white, print-on-demand paperback book becomes just one of the physical artifacts of the project. All of the artists' files come together in this Index/Reader as a "defense of poor media," prioritizing accessibility and circulation over craft and polish. Potent texts by Alexander Galloway (an interview) and Silvio Lorusso (a manifesto), grabbed from the web, provide some context and framing.

A collection of 10 colorful print-on-demand zines focuses the material into curated groupings. A tight selection of 10 images printed onto neoprene fabric slows some of the work down even further, wrapping PDFs around books like insulating skin.

If the books, zines and skins are a meager attempt to fix some stability into the work as printout matter, downloads of ZIPs, PDFs and a single 147-page-frame GIF allow “readers” of Printed Web 3 to perform their own digital versions of the material. All 329 files submitted to the open call are organized into artist folders as an archive (in the order that I received them). These files may be browsed, downloaded, printed, posted and circulated. 

Printed Web 3 launches on Rhizome (18 May), at Offprint London at the Tate Modern (22–25 May) and at Athens Digital Arts Festival (21–24 May).
