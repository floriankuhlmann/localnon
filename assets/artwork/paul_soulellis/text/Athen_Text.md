Can a publication be a GIF? The third issue of Printed Web takes the form of books, zines and fabric skins — a meager attempt to fix some stability into the collected work of 147 artists as printout matter. Downloads of ZIPs and PDFs allow readers of Printed Web 3 to perform their own digital versions of the material. Printed_Web_3.gif contains 147 page-frames — one digital file from every artist who submitted to the Printed Web open call in January–February 2015.
